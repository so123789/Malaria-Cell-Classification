# Malaria-Cell-Classification

The "Malaria Cell Classification using Deep Learning" project is aimed at leveraging the power of deep learning to automate and enhance the process of diagnosing malaria from microscopic images of blood smears. By training a deep neural network on a large dataset of labeled images, this project aims to develop an accurate and efficient tool for identifying malaria-infected cells, thereby aiding medical professionals in early and reliable diagnosis.
